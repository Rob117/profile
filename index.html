      h3.text-center Backend and DevOps
      p This is my strongest skill. I've done everything from small, four-page mostly static sites to massive original projects with integrated phone services and worker clusters on continuous deployment.
      p I have extensive AWS skill and can manage projects from planning and architecture decisions to deployment and maintenance.
      h3.text-center Game Dev
      p I've worked on two separate MMOs, one in development and one that had already been released. Between that and my hobby development experience, I am very comfortable with C# and the Unity game engine.
      p I was also responsible for server side programming in C++, but it's not my strong suit.
      p <strong>Note to recruiters</strong>: I am not currently seeking game development work.
      p <strong>Note to indies and small studios</strong>: Absolutely let's build something together!
      h3.text-center Translation & Localization
      p I currently do consulting work as a Japanese national translator and localizational specialist for Mindgeek. I work as the sole translator on a top 100 website and exclusively handle all localization from English into Japanese.
